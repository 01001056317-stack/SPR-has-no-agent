This is a binomial probability question. I’ve never seen this this sort of probability question on an ACT, but it’s essentially the same as a binomial theorem expansion which they have done.

The probability of having k successes in n trials with probability p is:

P = nCk + p^k * (1-p)^n-k

So in this case it’d be:

P = 100C1 * (0.01)^1 * (0.99)^99

This is the same as (B).
I believe it should be A.

1/100 \* (99/100 \* 99/100 \* 99/100 \* ...)

1/100 \* (99/100)\^99

.01 \* .99\^99
